    <h3>The idea here is to print out 1 problem that has all different variations at once, such that it could be used as a reference for making Worksheets</h3>
    <ul>
        <h3>Example for a stoichiometry problem</h3>
        <li>Print out equation with all needed info such as balanced equation, molar mass of each species, and any applicable data needed to solve the problem, excluding given values that are varied</li>
        <li>Print out a sample calulation for each different question type</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Something like below</h3>
    <ul>
        <h3>For stoichiometry</h3>
        <li id="rxn"></li>
        <li id="mm"></li>
    </ul>
